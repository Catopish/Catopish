## ðŸ›  My Linux & Neovim Setup

As a Linux enthusiast, Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time perfecting my development environment. My daily driver is Arch Linux, where I enjoy the simplicity and control it offers. Iâ€™m also a recently tried NixOS for its declarative approach to system configuration.

### Neovim Configuration
Iâ€™ve configured Neovim to enhance my productivity based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim):
